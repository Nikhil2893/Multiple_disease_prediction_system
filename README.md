# Multiple_disease_prediction_system
## Introduction
This project is the compilation of three different prediction systems, are as follows:

**1.Diabetes Detection system**

## Multiple Disease prediction system
### Steps to be followed for prejects deployment

1.As Diabetes Detection system,Parkinson's Disease Detection and Heart Disease prediction system are three different machine learning projects.
Three files are 

1.1 Project_2_SVM_Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb

1.2 Project 9.Logistic Regression Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb

1.3 Project 14 Parkinson's Disease Detection.ipynb

Basic Steps are followed to make prediction(ML) models

Step1. Importing Dependencies

Step2. Importing dataset

Step3. Splitting data into train and test

Step4. Model Training

Step5. Model Evaluation

Step6. Saving model as .sav file with the help of Pickle

Step7. Coding UI App with streamlit

Step8. Run the app


2.All three projects are saved differently as .sav files different folder using pickle.

Three files are 

2.1 diabetes_model.sav

2.2 heart_model.sav

2.3 parkinson_model.sav

3.Prediction system UI also coded in Streamlit.

Multiple disease prediction.py

4.All the three projects are deployed on localhost using streamlit. 

## Run

streamlit run app.py
